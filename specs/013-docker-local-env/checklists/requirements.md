# Specification Quality Checklist: Docker Local Development Environment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details in Requirements and Success Criteria (technical details appropriately placed in Assumptions/Dependencies/Out of Scope)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (developer productivity)
- [x] Written for target audience (developers are the users of this feature)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (time-based metrics: 5min, 15sec, 95%, etc.)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (changed "docker-compose up" to "環境起動コマンド")
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (3 user stories with Given-When-Then)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (4 edge cases documented)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section defines boundaries)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (separate sections for each)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (8 functional requirements)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (3 prioritized user stories: P1, P2, P3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (5 success criteria defined)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (implementation details properly segregated)

## Validation Summary

**Iteration**: 1 of 3
**Result**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

### Changes Made:
1. Modified SC-001 to use technology-agnostic language ("環境起動コマンド" instead of "docker-compose up")

### Ready for Next Phase:
- ✅ Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- ✅ No clarifications needed
- ✅ All quality criteria met
