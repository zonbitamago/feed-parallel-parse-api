# Specification Quality Checklist: 2件目フィード購読時のプレビュー表示バグ修正

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ All items passed

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Implementation details are isolated in "Technical Context (for understanding only)" section, clearly marked as non-requirements
- ✅ Focus is on user value: "ユーザーは追加しようとしているフィードが正しいものかを確認できる"
- ✅ Written in plain language with clear problem description and expected outcomes
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ No clarification markers needed - bug is well-understood with clear root cause
- ✅ Each requirement is testable:
  - FR-001: Can verify preview displays for 2nd+ feed
  - FR-002: Can verify API request is sent
  - FR-003: Can verify useEffect triggers only on `url` change
  - FR-004: Can verify 1st feed flow unchanged via existing tests
  - FR-005: Can verify error handling unchanged
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "500ms以内" (quantitative)
  - SC-002: "連続して10件" (quantitative)
  - SC-003: "全て合格" (verifiable)
  - SC-004: "リクエストが確認できる" (verifiable)
  - SC-005: "動作が変更されていない" (verifiable)
- ✅ Technology-agnostic phrasing in success criteria (focuses on user outcomes, not implementation)
- ✅ 5 detailed acceptance scenarios + 5 edge cases defined
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Assumptions section documents context and constraints

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (1:1 traceability)
- ✅ User Story 1 covers complete bug reproduction and fix validation flow
- ✅ Success criteria align with user scenarios (preview display, consistency, no regression)
- ✅ Technical Context is clearly separated from specification requirements

**Special Note**: This specification includes "Technical Context" section for understanding purposes. This is acceptable because:
1. It's explicitly labeled "for understanding only" and "not requirements"
2. The actual requirements (FR-001 to FR-005) remain technology-agnostic
3. Context helps planning phase without leaking into specification requirements
4. Success criteria remain implementation-independent

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ `/speckit.plan`
